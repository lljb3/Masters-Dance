# Masters-Dance
Kake Multimedia and ProdHMD's WordPress custom theme for all sites.

Currently on version: 1.0.0!

## Before Installation

Please remember to only install Fusion Page Builder as I took the time to make it compatible with Bootstrap 4.1. Bootstrap Shortcodes is not. Never install that again. There is also no need to comment any lines out anymore, as RequireJS is not included and there are no JS conflicts.

Also important is to make sure you navigate to Settings > Fusion and make sure "Enable Bootstrap" is turned off. Since this theme is bundled with it, there's no need for two loads of it.

## After Installation
 
Please make sure to go thru every option in Theme Options in order to ensure a quality base template.

## Coming Soon To The Next Version:

1. Expand on ReactJS & replace template files from PHP format with JSX format.

2. Expand on further theme options, such as different Header layouts to select and dynamically load.
